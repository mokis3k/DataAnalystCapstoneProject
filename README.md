# IBM Data Analyst
IBM Data Analyst Course Final Project on Coursera
This is the Capstone Project for Course 9, IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project. Part of IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera. Available here: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst

The role of a Data Analyst will be assumed within a global IT and business services firm. In this role, several datasets will be analyzed to identify trends in emerging technologies. The position has recently been filled by a Data Analyst in a global IT and business consulting services firm known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, data is regularly analyzed within the organization to help identify future skill requirements.

As part of this initiative, data will be collected from various sources and trends will be identified for this yearâ€™s report on emerging skills.

### Task 1
The first task is to collect data on the technology skills that are most in demand from various sources, including job postings, blog posts, and surveys. Data will be gathered by scraping internet websites and accessing APIs, with the information obtained in various formats such as .csv files, Excel sheets, and databases.

### Task 2
Once sufficient data has been collected, it will be prepared for analysis using data wrangling techniques such as identifying and removing duplicates, detecting missing values, and inputting the missing values.

### Task 3
Now that the data is ready, statistical techniques will be applied to analyze it and to identify insights and trends, such as the top programming languages in demand, the most sought-after database skills, the most popular IDEs, and demographic information such as the gender and age distribution of developers.

### Task 4
In the fourth task, appropriate visualizations will be chosen based on the data to be presented, using charts, plots, and histograms to reveal findings and trends. Data will be accessed from an SQL database, and only the required information will be extracted into DataFrames.

### Task 5
For task 5, IBM Cognos Analytics will be employed to create interactive dashboards, allowing the data to be analyzed and presented dynamically.

### Task 6
For the final task, storytelling skills will be employed to provide a narrative and to present the findings of the analysis.

## Data Description
Stack Overflow, a popular website for developers, conducted an online survey of software professionals across the world. The survey data was later open sourced by Stack Overflow. The actual data set has around 90,000 responses.

The dataset we are going to use comes from the following source: https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/ under a ODbL: Open Database License.

A subset of the original dataset will be provided for this capstone project. The dataset will be explored, analyzed, and visualized, and the resulting analysis will be presented.

Note: This randomised subset contains around 1/10th of the original data set. Any conclusions we draw after analyzing this subset may not reflect the real world scenario.

## Tools
- `python` v3.12.2
- `pandas` for managing the data.
- `numpy` for mathematical operations.
- `seaborn` for visualizing the data.
- `matplotlib` for additional plotting tools.
- `folium` for geospatial data visualization such as choropleth maps.
- `plotly` for interactive plotting tools.
- `IBM Cognos Analytics` for dashboards.
